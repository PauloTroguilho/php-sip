This is a PHP implementation of a simple SIP user agent.

It is still work in progress.

Currently only Linux OS is supported. Windows version will be released soon.

PHP-SIP is not a VoIP phone. It is not possible to make "voip calls" - only SIP signalling is supported.

It can be used for:

 * click to call
 * SIMPLE instant messaging
 * Message Waiting Indication NOTIFY
 * more...
